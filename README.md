# wmu

More advanced than Markdown, simpler than LaTeX

This is a library that converts wmu to html.

**Note** this repository is not ready yet for its first beta release!!! There are still many things that need to be finished, figured out or rewriten.

Read the [quick introduction](wmu.md) to get an idea of wmu markup

## Main issues

- using JS find and replace is fast but doesn't result in clean/solid code
- started as proof-of-concept js code, so it's not really clean and solid everywhere (yet!)
- i am still figuring out what wmu should be like, so some code is a bit experimetal/temporary
- css files are also just to make it work and/or temporary

## Run the code

### 1 In a browser

```
> npm install
> npm run build
```

Then open `/examples/demo/demo.html` in your browser!

### 2 In VS Code

Open in VS Code and run (F5)

## Todo

- `|cover`
- `> npx wmu --watch`
- not only return html, but also errors and warnings
- alternatieve-regex.js
- in latex `{\"o}` is automatically converted to `รถ`
- todo: inline en block list?!
- todo: markdown compatability?
- adding |toc -> set createtoc to true
- output list of all used css classes
- footnotes, chapter endnotes, book endnotes
- footnote: -> note
- unescape inline markup etc. (for writing about wmu)
- escape all characters
- escape blocks: |par \|code
- idee: **title** en daarna paragraaf tekst -> markdown-header-3

## Todo - programmeren

- soms nog 'var' ipv 'let'?
- ts: return types van function ed
- ook css met webpack naar /dist/: https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/
